# CUA Grant Submitting Checklist
The necessary documents and a checklist to submit a NASA NSPIRES grant under CUA.

Step 1 proposals are easy and should be submitted with at least half a work day for CUA to approve. 

In general, the deadline for submitting a step 2 proposal to CUA is 3 - 5 working days before the NASA deadline. It is good to check with Ralph Albano to see if there are any univeristy holidays that could affect that deadline. 

International collaboration is difficult or impossible. Check early if you need an international collaborator. 

Sub-contracts are do able, but be aware that CUA charges 26% on the first $25,000 of the subcontract.
